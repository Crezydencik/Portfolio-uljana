          Passionate communicator with a deep interest in marketing and journalism
          </h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          From an early age, I had an irresistible desire to communicate with people and create valuable content for society. Over time, I combined these passions and discovered my true loveâ€”Marketing, Advertising, and Journalism. Currently, I am a second-year university student specializing in Marketing and Journalism, diving deep into the digital marketing sphere and applying various methods in practice.

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
          At the same time, I specialize as a journalist in the Polish editorial office. I have gathered a vast stock of knowledge and experience that I am eager to apply in various fields. Creativity and constant movement are key to a happy life for me!
